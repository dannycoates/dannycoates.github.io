        <h2># Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I have 20 years of professional experience as a full-stack developer
          and jack-of-all-trades. I enjoy collaborating on all phases of
          software from initial design, implementation, launch, operation,
          maintenance, and transitions. I'm most confident as a lead developer
          and mentor, but also love resolving stubborn bugs and organizational
          problems. Over the years I've accrued skills for a laundry list of
          languages, cloud platforms, technologies, and development
          methodologies. I'm most proficient in Javascript, C#, and Ruby, but
          I'm also comfortable with Java, C/C++, Python, and Objective-C. I have
          considerable experience in scaling web applications. I value
          curiosity, teamwork, performance, reliability, empathy, honesty,
          privacy, and simplicity.

            Mozilla was a dream job. I was fortunate to work on many projects
            and had several roles on multiple teams over the years. On the
            Identity team I helped expand Persona and later designed and
            implemented the Firefox Accounts authentication service, serving
            millions of active users. I later joined the Test Pilot team leading
            or collaborating on a variety of experimental projects. I also
            managed and mentored groups of interns on projects like Firefox
            Send. The best part was collaborating with so many smart and kind
            people across the organization. I left to pursue another dream of
            running my own business.

            I scaled the audio backend service from 30k users to over 30M users.
            We implemented a unique, patented, method of delivering both live
            streamed and recorded audio seamlessly and simultaneously. We
            experienced exponential growth and had to refactor and optimize our
            Node.js applications quickly to meet demand. During this time I
            found and helped fix several critical bugs in Node.js core.

            I redesigned an existing PLSQL application in C#, architected its
            infrastructure to improve scalability and maintainability, and led
            the development and integration. The project was completed on time
            and provided an overall 10x performance improvement over the PLSQL
            system. Subsequent releases improved performance further. I also
            implemented a testing framework based on Cucumber and Ruby that has
            increased developer and subject matter expert collaboration and
            productivity immensely.

            I wrote a custom CD burner application for Power Music Inc. that
            burns mp3 music gaplessly to CD. The Mac version is written in
            Objective-C with Cocoa, and the Windows version is C++ and MFC. The
            burners preprocess the mp3 files to produce gapless audio files, and
            then burn the audio to disc. I designed the user interfaces to be
            simple. The programs could be run without any installation and file
            sizes were kept as small as possible for fast downloading, under
            1MB.

            As a member of the initial development team I designed, developed,
            and deployed a multi-platform software client used by over 150,000
            customers within 2 years to create dynamic workout programs mixed
            with their personal music. I collaborated with SMEs to design and
            implement a data model for the business. I led a team that created a
            training assistant application for mobile phones, before the iPhone,
            in which the user can interact with their training program in
            real-time. That project resulted in the establishment of a
            subsidiary company. Our team integrated server systems with client
            software in a unique way that unified the user experience. We used
            an agile approach to development that quickly produced working,
            useful products. I was considered the expert of the core business
            technology.
